## How do I add my theme?

To add your theme, open a Pull Request that adds a new object to the array in [themes.json](https://github.com/eludris/theme-store).
A valid theme entry contains:

- A name that is between 2 and 32 characters long;
- A url to a repository that contains a `style.css` and a `README.md`;
- A description that is between 16 and 128 characters long;

Please use the existing themes as examples if necessary.
